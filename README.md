This is the GitHub organization page for the [Homestuck Music Wiki](https://hsmusic.wiki)! A quick intro to the main repositories here:

* [hsmusic-wiki](https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic-wiki): Codebase for the `hsmusic` static wiki software. This has all the code for the music wiki (and other wikis built with it), issue tracking for planned features and known bugs, and pull requests documenting technical aspects behind updates and additions.
* [hsmusic-data]((https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic-data) and [hsmusic-media](https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic-media): Data and media repositories for [hsmusic.wiki](https://hsmusic.wiki/)! In addition to hsmusic-wiki, these are the repositories you need to actually build and run the music wiki. You can use these to have a complete offline copy on your own computer, and to directly contribute through pull requests, too.
* [hsmusic-lang](https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic-lang): Current localizations for the hsmusic-wiki software. Contributions here are done through a big Google Sheets document, but the latest versions of all localizations, ready to use with hsmusic-wiki, are public here.
* [hsmusic-docs](https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic-docs): Various handy documents describing the data format used in hsmusic-data (and other hsmusic repositories), plus guidelines describing the way the Homestuck music wiki does its own stuff.

This organization hosts repositories for some other wikis made with the hsmusic-wiki software:

* [skeleton-wiki](https://github.com/hsmusic/skeleton-wiki): A handy template for starting brand new wikis off of.
* [utdrmusic-wiki](https://github.com/hsmusic/utdrmusic-wiki), [utdrmusic-data](https://github.com/hsmusic/utdrmusic-data), and [utdrmusic-media](https://github.com/hsmusic/utdrmusic-media) - Undertale/Deltarune Music Wiki: https://utdr.hsmusic.wiki
* [sonicomix-wiki](https://github.com/hsmusic/sonicomix-wiki) and [sonicomix-content](https://github.com/hsmusic/sonicomix-content) - Sonic Comics Wiki: https://sonicomix.hsmusic.wiki

And some miscellaneous repos to do with the music wiki:

* [bc-art](https://github.com/hsmusic/bc-art): Python-based tool for nabbing full-resolution artwork from albums off Bandcamp. A very convenient utility for the music wiki's preservation efforts!
* [fefeta-bot](https://github.com/hsmusic/fefeta-bot): It's the bot that mods use to let you into [HSMusic's Discord server](https://hsmusic.wiki/discord/)!
* [hsmusic.github.io](https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic.github.io): Truly ancient repo where the wiki used to be hosted before it got its own domain.
